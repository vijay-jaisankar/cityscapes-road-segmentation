# ROADWHERE

## Dataset
The data from this project was sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dansbecker/cityscapes-image-pairs/). All credits go to the respective authors.

## Report
The findings of the experiments can be found in the [report](./semantic_segmentation_report.pdf). The LaTeX source can be found in [this directory](./roadwhere_report).

## Replication
The main notebook to be run with the configurations mentioned in the report can be found [here](./notebooks/segmentation_models_pretrained_backbones.ipynb).

This work is a part of my 20-credit project done under the supervision of Prof. Jaya Sreevalsan Nair.
